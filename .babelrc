// @babel/preset-env
// Purpose:
// @babel/preset-env is a Babel preset that compiles modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backwards-compatible JavaScript that works in older browsers or environments.

// It automatically determines the necessary transformations based on the environments (browsers, Node.js versions, etc.) you support.

// How it works:
// Transpiles modern JavaScript syntax (like async/await, arrow functions, const, let, class, etc.) into equivalent code that older browsers can understand.

// The preset does this by analyzing your browser support requirements and adding the necessary polyfills or transformations.

//  @babel/preset-react
// Purpose:
// @babel/preset-react is a Babel preset specifically designed to transpile JSX syntax into regular JavaScript. JSX is the syntax used by React to define components and elements (e.g., <div>Hello World</div>).

// Without this preset, Babel would not know how to handle JSX syntax because it's not valid JavaScript by default.

// How it works:


// This preset converts JSX elements into the equivalent React.createElement calls. It also allows you to use other React-specific features, such as JSX fragments, the React import, and more.
